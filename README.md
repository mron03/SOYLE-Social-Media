## p.s soyle means speak in my mother language
### A functional implementational example of social media using django frameworks and basic API structure


This pet project was designed to better understand the concepts of django implementation and backend development. The basic structure is built along with a Youtube tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org. where basic page navigation, post uploading, sign up/sign in, profile page, and profile search functions where implemented.

After completing the full tutorial, next goals were to implement major missed functionalities of every other social platforms such as: 
* messaging
* commenting
* recent messages sent or received
* deletion of posts
* changing of personal data and security
* improve minor inconvinences

The presented above goals are accomplished, and future potential improvements are:
* button to disable comments
* set up privacy, billings and other unimplemented account settings
* notification list
* etc.
